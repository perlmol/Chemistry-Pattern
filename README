Chemistry/Pattern version 0.27
==============================

This module implements a generic molecule pattern matching engine. In other
words, a sort of "regular expressions for molecules". This module is part of
the PerlMol project, http://www.perlmol.org/.

Changes since version 0.26
        - Added 'reset' option to $pattern->match. Thanks to Peter Spiro!
        - Change the default bond matching test to account for aromaticity.
          Thanks to Liliana Felix Avila and Evan Yokum.
